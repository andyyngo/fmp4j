## Requirements

**All models**

- [x] start with `Fmp`
- [x] are implemented as Java 16+ records
- [x] implement the `FmpModel` interface
- [x] have `serialVersionUID`
- [x] have test: `is_serializable`
- [x] have test: `serializes`
- [x] use date time classes for dates, instead of strings, where appropriate
- [x] use value objects, instead of strings, where appropriate
- [x] have `*TestData` in `testFixtures`

**All services**

**General**
